🏥 Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning
📌 Project Overview
This project builds a Machine Learning system to predict whether a person has diabetes based on medical data. The system is implemented in Python using Google Colaboratory.

For this use case, we use the Logistic Regression model for prediction (though the README mentions Support Vector Machine, ensure the correct model is used).

🚀 Technologies Used
Python
Pandas (for data handling)
NumPy (for numerical computations)
Scikit-Learn (for model training and evaluation)
Matplotlib & Seaborn (for data visualization)
Google Colaboratory (for implementation)
📊 Dataset
We use a diabetes dataset containing medical diagnostic measurements such as:

Glucose level
Blood Pressure
BMI (Body Mass Index)
Insulin levels
Age
Pregnancies
Each instance is labeled as:

1 – The person has diabetes
0 – The person does not have diabetes
🏗️ Project Workflow
Data Preprocessing

Load the dataset
Handle missing values (if any)
Normalize data for better model performance
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Visualize feature distributions
Identify correlations in the dataset
Model Training

Split dataset into training and testing sets
Train a Logistic Regression model
Model Evaluation

Calculate accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
Plot confusion matrix for better understanding
